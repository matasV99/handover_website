# 👤 About the Author

**Name:** Matas Vitkauskas  
**Role:** Research Officer (dry-lab)  
**Institute:** Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS)

I worked on computational analysis for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets, focusing on glioblastoma (GBM) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Most projects involved custom pipelines in R/Python and infrastructure on AWS (S3, Ronin) and GIS R-drives.
