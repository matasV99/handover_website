# üß¨ Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (PD) Projects

This section covers all PD-related computational work, including MERFISH, scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and multi-modal analyses on hMLOs and DJ-1 KO human midbrain-like organoids (hMLOs).

## üîç Key Datasets

- **MERFISH**:
    - WT and DJ-1 KO midbrain-like organoids (Generated by: Jessica Xie, Spots assigned + analyzed by: Matas Vitkauskas).
    - Final preprocessed object: [INSERT PATH TO FINAL OBJECT IN S3 BUCKET]
- **scRNA-seq**:
    - Two sequencing batches of 8 hMLO WT datasets (day 60-156) and 4 x 4 WT and paired DJ-1 KO datasets (day 60-150). Aligned using Cell Ranger and analyzed using Seurat and other third-party R packages by: Matas Vitkauskas.
    - Final peprocessed object: [INSERT PATH TO FINAL OBJECT IN S3 BUCKET]
- **Bulk RNA-seq**: 
    - SNCA-A30P, PARK2 KO, PINK1 KO, GBA KO, GBA (Junghyun Jo, Yang Lin).
    - LBLI D60/D90 samples from Annals of Neurology 2021 paper.
    - day 60 WT vs DJ-1 KO (Jessica Xie).

## üß† Analysis Highlights

1. Both scRNAseq and MERFISH are used on hMLOs.
2. hMLOs have topographical segmentation that mimic in-vivo-like patterns (areas representing dopaminergic and GABAergic regions).
3. Four DaN Subtypes across the vulnerabilty-resilience transcriptomic axis in PD.
4. DJ-1 perturbation reveal broad mitochondrial dysregulation across all cell types and synpatic dysfunciton specific to dopaminergic neurons.

## üìÅ Data Storage

- **S3 Bucket** for data (Need private keys to access): `s3://test.store.genome.sg`
- **GIS R Drive** for slides (Need GIS VPN to access): `S:\GIS-Liujy\Vitkauskas_Matas`

See `Data_Storage.md`  for detailed structure.
